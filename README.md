# Hippo

Hippo is a happiness tracker and a happiness trainer. Currently, Hippo is an experimental prototype, so it does not have an open source code base for the time being.

In the future we look forward to having open repositories with components we think will be of use to the community. but for the time being it only exists as an Android application.

If you would like to give the app a try please visit: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.hippo

Or if you would like more information please contact david@hippo.rocks.
